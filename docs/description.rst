SoMo is a light wrapper around pybullet that facilitates
the simulation of continuum manipulators.

SoMo (**So**\ ft\ **Mo**\ tion) is a framework to facilitate the
simulation of continuum manipulator motion in `PyBullet physics engine <https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/tree/master/examples/pybullet>`_. In SoMo,
continuum manipulators are approximated as a series of rigid links
connected by spring-loaded joints. SoMo makes it easy to create URDFs of
such approximated manipulators and load them into pybulletâ€™s rigid body
simulator. With SoMo, environments with various continuum manipulators
(such as hands with soft fingers or snakes) can be created
and controlled with only a few lines of code.
